# CSTII-Dissertation
A clone of my final-year project dissertation for Part II of the Computer Science Tripos, entitled *"Molecular multiplex network inference"* and supervised by [Dr Pietro Li√≤](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/).

The implementation described within this dissertation corresponds to the [CSTII-Ariana](https://github.com/PetarV-/CSTII-Ariana) repository. However, keep in mind that no further development (since submission) has happened on this repository. 

For the latest version of what developed from Ariana, visit [muxstep](https://github.com/PetarV-/muxstep).
